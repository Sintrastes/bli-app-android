BedellLibrary Interface Android
===============================

This is an Android application intended to provide a convienient interface to the [BedellLibrary server](https://github.com/Chinchillord/Bedellibrary). Currently, this is being used for testing purposes as we develop both the server and the app, but in the future we intend to add more features and documentation.
